            <h2>Leading causes of death, Australia </h2>
            <p>
                Suicide stands as a significant societal concern, ranking as the <b>15th leading cause of death</b> in 2022 (Figure 1).
                Australian Bureau of statistics reveals that individuals who lost their lives to suicide had a median age of 45.6 at the time of their passing, 
                and the year 2022 witnessed a total of 3,249 recorded suicides. 
                <br> <br>
                These stark figures underscore the urgency for heightened awareness 
                and support mechanisms to address the alarming issue of suicide. It is evident that this is an issue demanding serious attention
                and a collective effort to prevent further loss of life.

            <p  id="padding">
                Figure 2 sheds light on a substantial finding. Over the five-year period from 2018 to 2022, 
                the dataset records a total of  <b>12,327</b> documented <b>suicides</b>, making it the highest among all regions examined. 
                <br> <br>
                Notably, individuals born in Australia had a striking suicide rate of 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people, 
                surpassing the rates in America (8.2 deaths per 100,000 people) and Oceania and Antarctica (14.2 deaths per 100,000 people).
                 This data underscores the significance of understanding and addressing the variations in suicide rates among 
                 different regions, with Australia standing out as an area requiring particular attention and support.

            <p>
                The data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics underscores a concerning trend where a substantial majority of these tragic fatalities, making up three-quarters of the total, were concentrated among individuals who called New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland their usual residence.
                <br> <br>Notably, the Northern Territory displayed a particularly alarming suicide rate, peaking at 20.5 suicides per 100,000 people (Figure 3),
                raising significant concerns for this region.

                Figure 4 vividly illustrates the increased vulnerability of young and middle-aged individuals to suicide,
                accounting for a significant 81.7% of all suicide cases among those under the age of 65. 
                This is further emphasized by the notably lower median age of suicide victims at 45.6 years, 
                a stark contrast to the general median age of death at 82.2 years.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Gender disparities</b> were also evident, with <b>15.5%</b> of <b>female</b> suicides occurring in individuals under 25 years of age, 
                and <b>10.5%</b> among <b>males</b> in the same age group. 
                These findings highlight the distinct age-related trends in suicide rates, underscoring the heightened susceptibility 
                of younger populations.

            <p id="padding">
                Mood disorders, particularly <b>depression</b>, emerged as the predominant risk factor across all age groups, except for individuals aged 85 years and older. In this oldest age category, the primary risk factor remained limitations in daily activities due to illness and disability.
                <br> <br>
                Conversely, factors linked to employment and unemployment were most frequently cited as risk factors in the 
                age group spanning 45 to 64 years. These findings highlight the varying risk factors associated with different 
                age segments, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches to mental health and well-being support. </p>
